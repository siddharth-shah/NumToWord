NumToWord
=========

I have written a code for converting a Numeric representation of a Number to it's Equivalent Word Representation.

e.g.

1 to One
2 to Two
3 to Three
123 to One Hundred Twenty Three
etc etc.

IT SUPPORTS VALUES ONLY LESS THEN 1000,000,000,000
That means you can count upto Billions...

You have to hardcode the input.
